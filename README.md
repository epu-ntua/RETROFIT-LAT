# Building-retrofiting-latvia
A comprehensive dataset of energy performance, retrofitting, and sustainability measures for 1010 residential building projects funded by the Republic of Latvia’s Environmental Investment Fund (LEIF). The repository includes two key datasets:

1. **Building Retrofitting Data**
   - Covers energy performance before and after retrofitting (1870–2022).
   - Metrics: energy consumption, CO2 emissions, energy classes, heat loss coefficients, renewable/non-renewable energy contributions.
2. **Photovoltaic Installation Data**
   - Documents solar panel installations as energy efficiency measures.
   - Metrics: electricity consumption, primary energy use (pre- and post-installation), inverter power, and CO2 reduction.

This repository serves as a valuable resource for researchers, policymakers, and professionals evaluating the impact of retrofitting and photovoltaic installations on energy efficiency and sustainability in Latvia. It aims to support evidence-based decision-making and inspire similar initiatives globally.
